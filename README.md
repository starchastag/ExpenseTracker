💰Expenses is a [progressive web application](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) on top of [Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/) 📉 written in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) ⚛️. It is only a static HTML that works great on mobile 📱 and can be deployed anywhere.

## Get started

You will need a somewhat recent version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and a place to deploy static HTML under a custom domain (doesn't have to be top level). To get the full offline support with service workers you'll need HTTPS – [CloudFlare](cloudflare.com) works fine or you can use your own certificate.




```
npm create vite@latest
```
